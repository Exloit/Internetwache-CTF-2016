In the end, it's all about flags.
Whether you win or lose doesn't matter.
{Ofc, winning is cooler
Did you find other flags?
Noboby finds other flags!
Superman is my hero.
_HERO!!!_
Help me my friend, I'm lost in my own mind.
Always, always, for ever alone.
Crying until I'm dying.
Kings never die.
So do I.
}!
