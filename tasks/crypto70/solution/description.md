crypto70: Hashdesigner
============
There was this student hash design contest. All submissions were crap, but had promised to use the winning algorithm for our important school safe. We hashed our password and got "00006800007d". Brute force isn't effective anymore and the hash algorithm had to be collision-resistant, so we're good to go, aren't we?
